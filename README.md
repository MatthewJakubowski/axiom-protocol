## 🤖 About This Project
**"My Road to 1% Developer" Series**

This is a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** designed to explore advanced system architecture, Game Theory, and Python modularity. 

* **Concept & Architecture:** Designed by Matthew Jakubowski.
* **Code Implementation:** Generated in collaboration with AI (Google Gemini) to study advanced patterns (Dataclasses, Cryptography logic).

**Goal:** I built this to understand how complex systems (like anti-disinformation protocols) can be structured in Python, moving beyond basic scripts to full architectural frameworks.

## 🌍 The Problem
In the age of Generative AI, the cost of creating fake news is zero. We need a system where truth is backed by economic stakes.

## 🛡️ The AXIOM Solution
1.  **Reputation Staking:** Lying costs money (Slashing).
2.  **Sybil Defense:** Bots cannot afford to attack the network.
3.  **Provenance:** Tracking the origin of data (C2PA style).

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python main.py
